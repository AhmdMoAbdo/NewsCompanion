# News Companion
News app using UIKit.

The idea behind the app is quite obvious to browse different news from different categories with the ability to save any article for future reading and also the ability to search for any topic of interest.
The app also caches any loaded articles for offline browsing to be able to save articles to read whenever connected again to the internet.

Technologies used in the app:

1- Swift

2- MVVM Architecture

3- SwiftData for caching

4- Other CocoaPods including KingFisher, LottieAnimation
